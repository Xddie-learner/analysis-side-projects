# analysis-side-projects
I had a background in business and supply chain from Deakin
I love to have good solutions, avoid biases through using toolkit in Python such as Numpy or Scikit-learn, SQL.  
I uploaded some practical problems I learnt to analyse during my Python course.
If there are any errors, please let me know and I would love to connect to further discuss about them.
I am also a foodie and Machine Learning student
